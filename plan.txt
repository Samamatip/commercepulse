1. Store historical data in mongoDB (Mark as synthetic data and generate event_Id for them, add meta_data to mark event)
2. Create live events scripts to be run daily, to follow a schema with event_id when any event is performed
{
    event_id
    event_type
    event_time
    vendor
    payload
    ingested_at
}

3. Create Postgres database for analytics
4. Normalise data into tables: 
    dimensions table: ( 
        customer, 
        product, 
        date 
    ), 
    facts table: ( 
        orders (current order state) 
        payments (append-only) 
        refunds (append-only) 
        shipments 
        order_daily (aggregates) 
    )
5. Calculate derived metrics and save them into tables
    -Daily gross vs net revenue
    -Payment success rate by vendor
    -Average time from order creation to payment
    -Refund rate and partial refunds
    -Percentage of late-arriving events
    -Top products by revenue

6. Transform and reconcile different data payload to conform into established tables
7. Anomaly reporting
