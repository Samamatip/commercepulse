What is our true daily revenue after refunds?
Which vendors have the highest payment failure rates?
How long does it take for orders to move from creation to payment?
How often do refunds arrive days after revenue has already been reported?


### KEY ISSUES
Conflicting numbers between reports
Orders marked “paid” without successful payments
Refunds missing from historical revenue
No traceability from analytics back to raw data
Inability to reprocess data safely when logic changes


### CONSTRAINTS
Use MongoDB as the raw landing zone
Use incremental extraction (no full reloads)
Handle late and duplicate events
Ensure idempotent pipeline runs
Normalize historical and live data consistently
Produce daily data quality reports
Use GitHub with meaningful commit history


### DOCUMENTATIONS
You must document decisions around:
Historical batch vs live event handling
MongoDB vs PostgreSQL responsibilities
Append-only vs upsert strategies
Pandas vs SQL transformations
Correctness vs performance
Simplicity vs long-term maintainability


### FINAL DELIVERABLES
GitHub repository with clean structure
Fully runnable pipeline
SQL schemas and indexes
Daily data quality reports
README explaining architecture, assumptions, and trade-offs
